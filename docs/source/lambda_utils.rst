LambdaUtils
===========

Lambda handler middleware.

Overview
^^^^^^^^

There's a lot of boilerplate in Lambda handlers. This collection of utility functions leverages the great
`Middy <https://middy.js.org>`_ library to add middleware functionality to Lambda handlers.
You can extend it with your own middleware.

Middy gives you a great start as a solid middleware framework,
but by itself you are still repeating the middleware registrations
on each handler, its exception handler only works with errors created by the http-errors package,
and you still have to format your response in the shape required by API Gateway.

``LambadUtils`` takes Middy further and is extendable so that you can add your own middleware
(authentication & authorization, maybe?) on top of it.

Used with API Gateway, the included middlewares:

- Set CORS headers.
- Normalize incoming headers to mixed-case
- If incoming content is JSON text, replaces event.body with parsed object.
- Ensures that event.queryStringParameters and event.pathParameters are defined, to avoid TypeErrors.
- Ensures that handler response is formatted properly as a successful API Gateway result.
   - Unique to LambdaUtils!
   - Simply return what you want as the body of the HTTP response.
- Catch http-errors exceptions into proper HTTP responses.
- Catch other exceptions and return as HTTP 500.
   - Unique to LambdaUtils!
   - Besides providing better feedback to the client, not throwing an exception out of your handler means that your
     instance will not be destroyed and suffer a cold start on the next invocation.
- Leverages async syntax.

See `Middy middlewares <https://middy.js.org/#available-middlewares>`_ for details on those.
Not all Middy middlewares are in this implementation, only common ones that are generally useful in all
APIs. You may extend LambdaUtils's ``wrapApiHandler()`` function in your projects,
or use it as an example to write your own, to add more middleware!

``LambdaUtils`` depends on two other utilities to work:

- :doc:`logger`
- `Middy <https://middy.js.org>`_

Install
^^^^^^^

**To use LambdaUtils v3.x with Middy v1.x.x (latest):**

.. code-block:: shell

    npm install @sailplane/lambda-utils@3 @sailplane/logger @middy/core @middy/http-cors @middy/http-event-normalizer @middy/http-header-normalizer @middy/http-json-body-parser

The extra @middy/ middleware packages are optional if you write your own wrapper function that does not use them. See below.

**To use LambdaUtils v2.x with Middy v0.x.x:**

.. code-block:: shell

    npm install @sailplane/lambda-utils@2 @sailplane/logger middy

Upgrading
^^^^^^^^^

To upgrade from lambda-utils v1.x or v2.x to the latest, remove the old with ``npm rm middy``
and then follow the install instructions above to install the latest. See also the
`Middy upgrade instructions <https://middy.js.org/UPGRADE.html>`_.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

General use
-----------

.. code-block:: ts

    import {APIGatewayEvent} from 'aws-lambda';
    import * as LambdaUtils from "@sailplane/lambda-utils";
    import * as createError from "http-errors";

    export const hello = LambdaUtils.wrapApiHandler(async (event: LambdaUtils.APIGatewayProxyEvent) => {
        // These event objects are now always defined, so don't need to check for undefined. ðŸ™‚
        const who = event.pathParameters.who;
        let points = Number(event.queryStringParameters.points || '0');

        if (points > 0) {
            let message = 'Hello ' + who;
            for (; points > 0; --points)
                message = message + '!';

            return {message};
        }
        else {
            // LambdaUtils will catch and return HTTP 400
            throw new createError.BadRequest('Missing points parameter');
        }
    });

See :doc:`examples` for another example.

Extending LambdaUtils for your own app
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: ts

    import {ProxyHandler} from "aws-lambda";
    import * as LambdaUtils from "@sailplane/lambda-utils";
    import {userAuthMiddleware} from "./user-auth"; //you write this

    export interface WrapApiHandlerOptions {
        noUserAuth?: boolean;
        requiredRole?: string;
    }

    export function wrapApiHandlerWithAuth(options: WrapApiHandlerOptions,
                                           handler: LambdaUtils.AsyncProxyHandler): ProxyHandler {
        let wrap = LambdaUtils.wrapApiHandler(handler);

        if (!options.noUserAuth) {
            wrap.use(userAuthMiddleware(options.requiredRole));
        }

        return wrap;
    }
