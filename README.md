This repository is developed and maintained by the [Onica](https://www.onica.com) Serverless Practice

(It is written in Typescript, but compiles to ES6 with Typescript type definition files.)

Each directory contains another NPM project and is independently published. 
See the docs directory for details of each project, or find it published [online](https://docs.onica.com/projects/sailplane).
